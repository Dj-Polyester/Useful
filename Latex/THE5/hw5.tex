In order that $(S,R)$ is poset, $R$ needs to be a partial ordering on $S$. Then, $R$ needs to be
\begin{enumerate}
    \item reflexive
    \item antisymmetric
    \item transitive
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{1)reflexivity}
\\ \\
For all $s$ in $S$, $s$ is a set, since the set $S$ is the power set of another set.
Every set is a subset of itself. Then $s$ is a subset of itself. Then $(s,s) \in R$.
We proved for all $s \in S$, $(s,s) \in R$. Then $R$ is reflexive.
\\ \\
\textbf{2)antisymmetry}
\\ \\
For any sets $s_1$ and $s_2$, if $s_1 \subseteq s_2$ and $s_2 \subseteq s_1$, then $s_1 = s_2$.
Then for any sets $s_1$ and $s_2$ in $S$, if $(s_1,s_2) \in R$, $s_1 \subseteq s_2$ and if 
$(s_2,s_1) \in R$, $s_2 \subseteq s_1$. Then $s_1=s_2$, hence $R$ is antisymmetric.
\\ \\
\textbf{3)transitivity}
\\ \\
For any sets $s_1$,$s_2$ and $s_3$, if $s_1 \subseteq s_2$ and $s_2 \subseteq s_3$, then $s_1 
\subseteq s_3$. Then for any sets $s_1$,$s_2$ and $s_3$ in $S$, if $(s_1,s_2) \in R$, $s_1 \subseteq s_2$ 
and if $(s_2,s_3) \in R$, $s_2 \subseteq s_3$. Then $s_1 \subseteq s_3$, hence $(s_1,s_3) \in R$. 
Hence $R$ is transitive.
\\ \\
$R$ is a partial ordering on $S$, hence $(S,R)$ is a poset.

\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{The elements $a$ and $b$ of a poset $(S,R)$ are called comparable if either $aRb$ or $bRa$.}   
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{If $(S,R)$ is a poset and every two elements of $S$ are comparable, $(S,R)$ is a total order.} 
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
Assume $a=\{1,2\} \in S$ and $b=\{0,1\} \in S$. Then neither $a \subseteq b$ nor $b \subseteq a$. Then 
$a$ and $b$ are incomparable. Since there is at least two elements that are not comparable within, in $S$;
by contradiction, $(S,R)$ is not a total order.

$(S,R)$ is a poset from part \textbf{(b)}. Assume subsets $s_1$ and $s_2$, $s_{max}$, $s_{min}$ 
of $S$ given, such that $s_1 \subseteq s_{max}$ and $s_2 \subseteq s_{max}$ and $s_{min} \subseteq s_1$ 
and $s_{min} \subseteq s_2$. Then by the definition(s) $(1)$, $s_{min}$ is a lower bound and $s_{max}$ 
is an upper bound for the set $\{s_1, s_2\}$. If $s_{max}$ is the least of all upper bounds, 
then $s_{max}=s_1 \cup s_2$, similiarly if $s_{min}$ is the greatest of all lower bounds, then 
$s_{min}=s_1 \cap s_2$.For all $s_1, s_2$ in $S$, we can find such $s_{max},\ s_{min}$. Then every 
pair $(s_1,s_2) \in R$ has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. Hence $(S,R)$ 
constitutes a lattice.

    \textit{An undirected graph is called connected if there is a path between every pair of distinct}\\
    \textit{vertices of the graph.}   
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
Assume an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ has two subgraphs $G_1=(V_1,E_1),\ G_2=(V_2,G_2)$ that are weakly connected components of $G$, 
that is there exists an edge $E_1 \in E$ and $E_1=\{v_1,v_2\}$ such that $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$. Further assume, $G_1$ and $G_2$
are both connected graphs. This means every vertex in $G_1$ is reachable from every vertex of $G_1$. This holds also for
$G_2$. Then starting from any vertex of $G_1$, we can reach $v_1$ and for $G_2$, $v_2$. We know $E$ connects $v_1,\ v_2$; then, any 
vertex of $G_1$ is reachable from any vertex of $G_2$ and vice-versa. Hence, $G$ is a connected graph. Therefore, if we prove for 
any undirected graph $G$, its two subgraphs are connected components of $G$, and they are connected subgraphs, we also prove that $G$ is a 
connected graph. From the textbook(Eighth Edition) page 721

    \textit{A directed graph is weakly connected if there is a path between every two vertices in the underlying}\\

If we prove that there is a path between every two vertices in the underlying undirected graph of the directed graph 
$G$ in the question, in other words that the underlying undirected graph is connected, we also prove that the directed
graph $G$ is weakly connected. We transform the graph into its corresponding undirected graph $H$ and divide it to two 
subgraphs $G_1=(\{a,b,f\},\{\{a,b\},\{b,f\}\})$ and $G_2=(\{c,d,e,g\},\{\{c,d\},\{c,e\},\{d,e\},\{d,g\},\{d,d\},\{e,g\}\})$.

Similarly, we divide $G_2$ into subgraphs $G_3=(\{c,d\},\{\{c,d\},\{d,d\}\})$ and $G_4=(\{e,g\},\{\{e,g\}\})$.
We can traverse between $c$ and $d$ through the edge $\{c,d\}$, then $G_3$ is connected. Similarly, 
we can traverse between $e$ and $g$ through the edge $\{e,g\}$, then $G_4$ is connected. $G_3$ and
$G_4$ are connected via the edges $\{c,e\},\{d,e\}$ and $\{d,g\}$ with multiplicity of $2$; hence, $G_2$ is connected. 
Vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent, we can traverse from $a$ to $b$, Vertices $b$ and $f$ are adjacent, we can traverse 
from $b$ to $f$, then we can traverse from $a$ to $f$ also; hence $G_1$ is connected. $G_1$ and
$G_2$ are connected via the edges $\{a,d\},\{b,c\},\{c,f\},\{e,f\}$; hence, $H$ is connected. We conclude that
the underlying undirected graph $H$ of the directed graph $G$ is connected, hence the directed graph $G$ is weakly connected.

From the textbook(Eighth Edition) page 729

\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{An Euler path in G is a simple path containing every edge of G.}   
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
The simple path $d-c-b-d-e-f-g-h-e-d-a-b$ is an Euler path, since it contains every edge of $G$.
Then $G$ has an Euler Path.
\subsection*{b)}
From the textbook(Eighth Edition) page 729
\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{A connected multigraph with at least two vertices has an Euler circuit if and only if each of} \\
    \textit{its vertices has even degree.}   
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
$G$ has $8$ vertices, more than two. Since the vertex $b$ has $3$ edges incident with it, then its degree is
$3$, which is odd. Then $G$ does not have any Euler circuits 
\subsection*{c)}

\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{A simple path in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once is called a Hamilton}\\
    \textit{path.} 
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
The simple path $a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h$ is a Hamiltonian path, since it passes through every vertex of $G$ once.
Then $G$ has an Hamiltonian Path.
\subsection*{d)}
From the textbook(Eighth Edition) page 734
\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{A simple circuit in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once is called a Hamilton circuit.}  
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
Let us observe two subgraphs of $G$, namely $G_1=\{V_1,E_1\}=\{\{a,b,c,d\},\{\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{c,d\},\{b,d\},\{a,d\}\}\}$, 
$G_2=\{V_2,E_2\}=\{\{e,f,g,h\},\{\{e,f\},\{f,g\},\{g,h\},\{e,h\}\}\}$. Assume $G$ has a 
Hamiltonian circuit with an initial vertex $v_0$. 
\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
    The circuit should pass through $d$ and $e$ exactly once (*).\\
    The circuit should pass through every vertex of $G_1$ and $G_2$ exactly once (**).
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
If $v_0 \in G_1$, since circuit passes through $d$ and $e$ exactly once, it must terminate at a vertex of $G_2$, in order
to pass through every vertex of $G_2$; however, $v_0 \notin V_2$, then this path is not a circuit. 
\\ \\
Similarly if $v_0 \in G_2$, since circuit passes through $d$ and $e$ exactly once, it must terminate at a 
vertex of $G_1$; however, $v_0 \notin V_1$. Then, by using (*) and (**), we disprove
that there is such a circuit. Then, there exists no such circuit. 
Hence by contradiction, $G$ has no Hamilton circuits.

\section*{Answer 4}
From a work of David Glickenstein, namely "Graph Theory Notes 5: Graphs as matrices, 
spectral graph theory, and PageRank", at page 1 \label{work}

    \textbf{Definition 1 }\textit{A permutation matrix is a matrix gotten from the identity by permuting the columns } \\

In our case, adjacency matrix of $G$, Ordering the vertices $a,b,c,d,e$

        1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
We observe that $G=G'$. Then the permutation matrix $P$ can be $5$x$5$ identity matrix, 
holding the equality (*). Since there exists such permutation matrix $P=I$, $G$ an $G'$
are isomorphic.

\subsection*{a)}
A pseudocode for Djikstra's Algorithm is below and at each step, variables are shown with a table below 
that contains the values of the vertices and previous vertices that are connected to them
in the shortest path from the initial vertex. The tables below show the values after the operations 
done at each step. (*) sign before the vertices' labels, mark adjacent unvisited vertices, since at each 
step only possible elements that are subject to change are adjacent unvisited vertices.

There are $7$ vertices, and $6$ edges in $T$. $f$ and $g$ have largest levels, $3$; then
height of $T$ is $3$.

In question, a is given as a root, then the tree is a rooted tree. 
Using (1), we see that a, c, e are internal vertices. Vertices a, c and e have two children ($m=2$), then 
the given tree is a full binary tree.

Leaves of the given tree are b, d, f, g. b, d and f are at different levels; hence, $T$ is not a
complete tree, then not a complete binary tree.
\subsection*{g)}

From the textbook(Eighth Edition) page 794, binary search trees have the following property
\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
    \textit{Vertices are assigned keys so that the key of a vertex is both larger than the keys of all vertices}\\
    \textit{in its left subtree and smaller than the keys of all vertices in its right subtree.}
\end{tabular}
\\ \\
\textbf{NOTE} Below, the term \textit{ordered} or \textit{sorted} is used for a sequence, when 
for every two values $a$ and $b$ in the sequence, if $a$ is on the left of $b$, then $a \leq b$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Lemma 1} An in-order traversal of a binary search tree with vertices that have unique keys
always prints the vertices of the tree in sorted order
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof by induction}\\ 
\textbf{BASE STEP} Printing a single vertex gives a sorted list with a length $1$\\
\textbf{INDUCTIVE STEP} Assume An in-order traversal of a binary search tree with 
$1,2,3...k$ vertices that have unique keys always prints the vertices of the tree in sorted order. 
Assume an additional vertex $a$ with a unique key is inserted. If we print the subtree $T_a$ that
$a$ is the root of, in inorder, we print $a$ in the middle, subtree with smaller values than 
$a$ on the left, subtree with larger values on the right. We know that inorder print of both 
subtrees of $a$ are ordered, since their number of vertices $n$ is less than or equal to $k$
- assuming an empty list is also ordered (trivial case $n=0$). Then 
inorder print of $T_a$ is ordered. Similarly we print the parent of $a$ in the middle, 
$T_a$ to the left if each value of $T_a$ is smaller than of parent of $a$, right if larger, 
in inorder traversal. 
Then inorder print of $T_p$, the tree that parent of $a$ is root of, is also ordered. 
We know that inorder print of remaining vertices of the tree 
was already ordered, before the insertion. Then inorder print of the new tree is also ordered, 
completing the proof.
\\ \\
Let us observe the sequence b,a,d,c,f,e,g which is obtained by inorder traversal in part \textbf{(d)}.
Substituting their values,the sequence becomes $13,17,19,24,23,43,58$ -every key is unique. The sequence is not ordered, since
$24$ is on the left of $23$, but $24 \leq 23$ does not hold. Then, by \textit{Lemma 1}, $T$ is not a binary search tree.

the minimum number of nodes for a full binary tree with height $5$ is $2*height+1=2*5+1=11$

    \textit{a rooted tree is the length of the longest path from the root to any vertex.}

The longest possible length from the root of a rooted tree with $k$ vertices is $k-1$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof by induction}\\
\textbf{BASE STEP} A single vertex is a tree, has $1-1=0$ height, which is the maximum possible height.\\
\textbf{INDUCTIVE STEP} Assume the longest possible length from the root of a rooted tree with $t$ vertices is $t-1$.
If, an additional vertex is inserted as a child of the most distant vertex (from the root), the height $h = t$, 
else $h = t-1$. Then, the longest possible length from the root of a rooted tree with 
$t+1$ vertices is $t$, completing the proof.
